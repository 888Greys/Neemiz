## 1.0.0 (2026-06-24)

First tagged production release — the baseline from which versioning begins.
Captures the current live platform (~2,500 users):

* Forex & binary trading surfaces (Deriv-style mobile UI), P2P marketplace,
  M-Pesa + crypto wallet, and server-authoritative bet settlement.
* Security hardening: off-box withdrawal signer with independent spend caps and
  a fail-closed kill switch, on-chain drainer auto-halt, seed-leak guards
  (pre-commit hook + gitleaks rule), and a full git-history secret scrub.
